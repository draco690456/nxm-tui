//! Injectable secret storage seam (I1, from study R5).
//!
//! `resolve_key` historically called `keyring::Entry` directly, which made it
//! both OS-dependent and untestable (the production native store is not the
//! `keyring_core` mock the tests install). This module introduces an
//! application-level [`KeyStore`] trait so key resolution can be driven by any
//! backend — the native OS keychain, a portable encrypted file, env-only, or
//! an in-memory fake in tests.
//!
//! Backends:
//! - [`EnvStore`] — level 0, reads from the environment only (no persistence).
//! - [`OsKeychainStore`] — wraps `keyring::Entry` (OS-native, may prompt).
//! - [`EncryptedFileStore`] — portable AES-256-GCM + Argon2id file (`keys.enc`).
//!
//! mai-log RIGID (D7): a secret value is NEVER logged or printed. Logs emit
//! only the provider name, presence, and the backend kind.
